# Go_bank_app

Build an application that will act as an ATM banking terminal. Will take some input from a user, shows user inputs and runs in a loop until they choose exit.

Also checks if they have negative amount or if they are broke.

This example will show how `Control Structures` work in Golang.

I am also creating a custom package and moving functionality around file operations into it's own folder. This will allow for cleaner readability and reusability.
